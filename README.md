## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to facilitate chat interactions with multiple PDF files using the Google Gemini model. By leveraging Google's Gemini model along with Langchain, this project enables users to upload PDF files, extract information using Langchain, convert it into vectors, and then utilize Google Gemini to ask questions related to the PDF content and receive answers.

## How It Works
This project utilizes several libraries and tools to achieve its functionality:
- Google Gemini: A conversational AI model developed by Google.
- Langchain: A library used for extracting information from PDF files and converting it into vectors.
- PyPDF2: A library for reading PDF files.
- Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web applications.
- python-dotenv: A module for managing environment variables.
- chromadb: A database for storing information extracted from PDFs.
- faiss-cpu: A library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- langchain_google_genai: A module for integrating Google's generative AI models with Langchain.

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries for this project, run the following command:


## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Set up your environment variables using a `.env` file.
4. Run the Streamlit application by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
5. Upload your PDF files using the provided interface.
6. Interact with Google Gemini by asking questions related to the content of the uploaded PDF files.
